## How Branch-Based Audit Works

### When Starting Work on a New Branch

1. AIDLC detects the current Git branch
2. Creates `audit/{branch-name}.md` if it doesn't exist
3. All interactions are logged to that branch's audit file

### Branch Name Sanitization

| Git Branch | Audit File |
|------------|------------|
| `main` | `main.md` |
| `feature/user-auth` | `feature-user-auth.md` |
| `bugfix/login-fix` | `bugfix-login-fix.md` |
| `feature/REQ-001-payment` | `feature-req-001-payment.md` |

### After Merging

1. Move audit file to `archived/` folder
2. Add summary to target branch (e.g., main.md)
3. Update this index
