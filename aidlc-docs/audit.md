# AIDLC Audit Trail - MIGRATED

> ⚠️ **This file has been migrated to the branch-based audit system.**

## New Location

All audit logs are now in:

```
aidlc-docs/audit/
├── audit-index.md          # Master index of all branches
├── main.md                 # Main branch audit (this project's history)
├── feature-{name}.md       # Feature branch audits
└── archived/               # Merged branch audits
```

## Quick Links

- **Audit Index**: [audit/audit-index.md](./audit/audit-index.md)
- **Main Branch Audit**: [audit/main.md](./audit/main.md)

## Why Branch-Based Audit?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Git Alignment** | Natural fit with feature branch workflow |
| **Team Clarity** | Each developer sees their branch's history |
| **Easy Review** | Audit history stays with feature in PRs |
| **Cleaner History** | Main branch audit stays focused |
| **Auto-Archive** | Natural archival when branches merge |
