## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Operations phase implementation (deploy, monitor)
- Additional code generation templates
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

---

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added
- **Fix/Resume Flow**: Handle post-completion errors without restarting full AIDLC workflow
  - Auto-detect completed workflows with error reports
  - Skip inception/design stages for simple fixes
  - Direct to Code Generation for targeted fixes
  - Track fix cycles in state file
  - Keywords: fix, error, bug, failed, broken, crash

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-15

### Changed
- **Command Simplification**: Reduced from 15 commands to 3 essential commands
  - Removed 12 individual stage commands (`aidlc-init`, `aidlc-reverse`, `aidlc-requirements`, `aidlc-stories`, `aidlc-plan`, `aidlc-design`, `aidlc-units`, `aidlc-functional`, `aidlc-nfr`, `aidlc-infra`, `aidlc-code`, `aidlc-build`)
  - Kept only: `/aidlc`, `/aidlc-status`, `/aidlc-multi-repo`
  - Rationale: Core-workflow handles all stages automatically, individual commands are redundant
- **core-workflow.mdc**: Added CHANGELOG update as mandatory step in Code Generation (Step 5)

### Updated
- **README.md**: Updated to reflect simplified command structure
- **.cursor/commands/README.md**: Updated with 3-command documentation
- **.cursor/commands/aidlc.md**: Enhanced with jump/re-run stage examples

  - New rule: `common/multi-repo-context.md` - Multi-repo management guide
  - Updated `workspace-detection.md` to detect related projects
  - Support for Frontend + Backend + Jobs separation
  - Cross-project impact analysis
  - Integration point documentation
  - Cursor multi-root workspace integration

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-15

### Changed
- **Branch-Based Audit Consistency**: Updated all rules and commands to use branch-based audit system
  - Updated 7 INCEPTION rules (workspace-detection, reverse-engineering, requirements-analysis, user-stories, workflow-planning, application-design, units-generation)
  - Updated 6 CONSTRUCTION rules (functional-design, nfr-requirements, nfr-design, infrastructure-design, code-generation, build-and-test)
  - Updated 6 COMMON rules (changelog-management, workflow-changes, terminology, session-continuity, error-handling, depth-levels)
  - Updated 3 Commands (aidlc-init, aidlc, README)
  - Updated core-workflow.mdc for consistency
  - All references now point to `aidlc-docs/audit/{branch}.md` instead of `audit.md`

---
